This new version is nowhere near as fun to play. Sure, it looks better, and there are more ways for you guys to make more $$ from it, but the new AI algorithm is simply a drag to play. With the old game, if I played 20 games, I could strategize and win about half of them. With this new version, I¡¯ve won only once in 20 games! And that¡¯s only because I refused to trade. The AI consistently ends up with more funds from giveaways and pays less taxes while the human pays more taxes and gets fewer random giveaways. Please rework the AI algorithm to make it a more enjoyable and better balanced game!!Reply to developer: I never accused the game of being ¡°rigged.¡± As any programmer knows, there is no such thing as ¡°random.¡± Programming any software takes human choice. My point was that the programming of the old version of Monopoly was more balanced than the present version, and as such, the present app needs to be reworked to be better balanced and more enjoyable to play.For version 1.3: the background (city) sounds are much too loud now!

I mean of all the the video games, why did my first one have to be this? Well, I actually got introduced by my classmates , whom have recently discovered the game. When we would ask what did you do for the weekend Amoung us would be a popular game they all played. After a while, I found myself wanting to play the game more and more. I downloaded the app and found myself loving it! The game was relatively easy to play, and fun. While, I enjoyed the game their were still some downsides. One of the major cons was the gaming community in the app. People can have offensive name, and bully people without getting kicked out of the game.

I can fairly say that it is a well-executed game with consistent updates and support. I like the creative side as well as the puzzle side it¡¯s a nice balance. One thing everyone should know unequivocally before beginning, however, is that the developers hate the players. Hate may not even be a strong enough word for it. I could be wrong, maybe it¡¯s impossible to fairly balance a puzzle game but to program it so much in the favor of you losing is... unsurprising considering how often it wants you to purchase things. Now, you don¡¯t have ads in this game, which is nice, and the options to purchase don¡¯t ensure victory (I mean at all), so in a sense the game is consistent and there¡¯s some comfort in that. The reward system is pretty rough, it does sometimes feel like an endless attempt to wear you down. You will rage quit from time to time, or put it down for a couple months, but this is a casual game. Whereas other games make me feel as if they¡¯ve earned my business, I find the challenge of this one is seeing how far I can go without spending any money, because it tries so hard. It¡¯s my tiny moral victory. But hey, great time waster so if that¡¯s what you¡¯re going for, you¡¯ll likely stay engaged and distracted from your reality and isn¡¯t that what we all want anyways?","You will rage quit from time to time, or put it down for a couple months, but this is a casual game.",3,TRUE,general,N/A,N/A,N/A,negative,0

But when i lost my iPod and got a new phone i didn¡¯t have it in my new phone and i just forgot to get up until recently when i decided to get it because my family was playing it. So i played it for the Miami world and the Peru world and i had most of the characters but when the Halloween update came out for this new season it wasn¡¯t updating my game. So i asked my cousin what to do and she said since you are logged on to Facebook and Game Center it will save your progress so i deleted the game so it would update and when i did i lost all my characters ( especially my favorite three Coco, Liu, and Aina). I was really sad about this but in the end i guess it¡¯s my fault for deleting the app, but i want to tell people that if this happens to you just wait it out especially if you¡¯re really far in the game sure you will miss out in a season but you won¡¯t loose your progress.

If you decide to just stick with private mode then you will be absolutely fine. You can have a fun time with some friends and overall enjoy this game. But then I tried public games.It wasn¡¯t as bad as you think it would be. I ran into a total of one weirdo and was totally fine. I had no problems. The only time something really weird happened was when somebody with a weird name had tried to get us to follow his/her Twitter, but thanks to the new update Among Us blocks your ability to redirect to another website in the chat. Here¡¯s the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players¡¯ IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can¡¯t find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack. However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately. I didn¡¯t want to be hacked. EVER. It was kind of scary even though I knew the extensive anti-hacking measures taken place by InnerSloth (the game¡¯s creator). While this game is fun, it¡¯s not worth it being scared every time my friends aren¡¯t up for a game. If you are getting this for a group of friends/family, then you are fine. But stick with private games, and if InnerSloth can, fix these hackers!!!!","However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately.",3,TRUE,general,N/A,N/A,N/A,negative,0

First of all when the game updated it basically restarted the game and got rid of all my coins, keys, characters...everything. I am pretty mad about that because it took a long time to save up for all the characters I got. I¡¯m really lucky because I didn¡¯t use any money to buy anything. If I did and they deleted everything then that would mean I just spent and wasted a whole lot of money. And I¡¯m pretty sure that is what happened to other people who bought stuff using real money. Another thing is the design. It¡¯s not that great. The graphics and layout are really childish. And now for some reason the game takes FOREVER to load. And it also for some reason only works at a certain time of day. It didn¡¯t do that before this terrible update came out. And it¡¯s not my WiFi because every other game works expect this one ??. It¡¯s really annoying because I used to give this game 5 stars but now I¡¯m giving it 2 stars.....yeah that pretty bad.
