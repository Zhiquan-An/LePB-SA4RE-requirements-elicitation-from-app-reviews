For some crazy reason, the notability text can never align itself with the notability grid. As a result, you get paragraphs of text that doesn¡¯t follow the line / grid that you have chosen for the page. Text often create their own grids, at varying line heights, which makes the entire document very ugly. The sync is also on and off between my devices. I¡¯ve had instances where I sat in lecture waiting for a page to sync from my mac to my iPad, but it never does. One time I waited 2 days before the pdf finally mysteriously appeared.

That is one of my favorite things about the Apple Pencil and it is not taken advantage of in this app. Another thing I would like to have in this app is subfolders. I like order and I would like to be able to organize my notes in such a manner that I have large folders then more folders within my folders and so forth.

It would be nice if the normal (12 point) font would actually show up on screen as 12 point instead of 0.5 point.  I know I can zoom the page to make text bigger, but then I have to scroll back and forth which is difficult for me to read.  I want the text to readjust to fit the boundaries of the screen.","bought the app, worked good the first time, now it opens with just the home page, wont do anything else, disappointed",4,TRUE,efficiency,font size,55,64,negative,0

It almost scares me how dependent I am on Notability.  Here¡¯s why.Every now and the, a glitch happens.  A common one is when I switch from one meeting to another, I close one note and open a new one.  Sometimes the recording function sends a message that the recording is being recovered.  Then, the recording attaches to the new note, so I am beginning a session with an unrelated recording.  Puzzling.A more concerning thing happened yesterday.  A notice on my iMac (2020 vintage) said I needed to update Notability, but when I selected the update option, I received a message that Notability was no longer on the App Store.  Still, the update option message persists.  Is this true?  The OSX version is no longer being updated?  If not, please fix the glitch on the App Store.Recent changes to the recording interface are obscure and perplexing... where are the user instructions?  I bet they exist somewhere, but why-o-why are they not on the web site?

I decided to try using an iPad Pro instead, since they¡¯re lighter. Notability was the only app to offer most of the same functionality as OneNote on a Windows tablet. There are many things that I prefer about Notability, but there are a few issues that prevent me from giving it more stars: first, I would like the ability to create a group of commonly used highlighters/pens for marking up documents. I have a system of using certain colors to represent certain things, and I would like to be able to organize all those highlighters and pens into a group where I determine the order and placement. If that is possible in Notability, I haven¡¯t been able to figure it out. Secondly, I use Notability in a setting where I¡¯m regularly working with several languages (including RTL - Right to Left languages like Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic). Notability does not have good support for combining multiple languages in one document at this time, especially not mixed English-Hebrew or English-Aramaic. Please give Notability the ability to recognize and format RTL languages. I can do that natively on most Apple apps, and many 3rd party apps, so the inability to do that on Notability really sticks out. Please improve these issues, and I will gladly give it a 5 star rating. In fact, if those two issues are fixed, I won¡¯t even miss using OneNote for most of my coursework.","I've always found Dropbox a bit buggy, but it's gotten worse since I updated to IOS 7  When I download zip files or webpages &amp open the files, the screen is blank, blackened or a blurred enlarged image of the symbol (of Facebook, Google or other symbols related to the site that the the zip file or webpages it came from

The in-game display is better organized, and the ""Scores"" page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.

However, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play-by-play. The ""team leaders"" appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--there's no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the ""Atlanta Falcons"" button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the ""Cincinnati"" button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams).

The app is very dynamic with the features it supplies for a spectacular note taking experience such as recording audio, inserting pictures, syncing data from iPad to MacBook, and more!Key feature recommendation: 1) Tabs:l would love to see this app implement the feature that Good Notes 4 has which is the tab function where you can have multiple documents open in a row of tabs at the top and also remembers where you are in the file when you want switch to another document. It is a bit inconvenient because sometimes l would transfer my notes to Good Notes 4 just to be able to switch between documents to study for exams. 2) Undo 2.0Hitting the back button sometimes can be slow especially when I¡¯m writing notes at the bottom of the page or when the lecturer talks very fast.

I take a lot of notes using my keyboard but now I found myself using my apple pencil just as much. I notice if I am write using my Apple Pencil or even if I add a picture then decide to go back to jot something down above my writing, the text start to overlap my writing instead of my writing or picture sliding down like on Apple notes. I wish in the next update hopefully sooner than later this can be fixed because this seems to be a huge disadvantage over Apple notes. I would like whatever I write using handwriting or added picture to stay aligned with the text. You are able to use wrap around but even using that feature the text just keep moving down and the picture is no longer aligned with the text i placed it with. This would be an awesome update even if it's a way to turn it on or off would be greatly appreciated. Thank you","We really enjoy this app while traveling When you're on the road and you're ready to stop to eat, this is a great app to find a good place We have found some really good places to eat that we would not have known about Having a map to get you there also helps 

One small issue I have is that when you ask what's near you, or when you use a filter, not everything shows up  An example is that I was trying to find info on a brew pub near our motel  It didn't show up on the map and when I asked for pubs near my current location it didn't show up in the search  But, when I searched by name, there was the pub and reviews",4,TRUE,efficiency,update,20,26,positive,1

Also, it would be great if there a lasso tool instead of clicking on writing because it sometimes selects unnecessary things. An option to change colors after writing something in a different color would be great. Make it similar to the tools on the Notes app Apple has. A lasso tool, elimination of random pen thickness, and change pen color after writing would be fantastic.

Also, I¡¯ve found that if I make more than one edit in a document it doesn¡¯t always save the edits after the first one.

It is easy to use, has some really awesome features and is really well designed. But because I payed $10 for it I am going to be more critical. The biggest issue I have with this app is the lack of tilt functionality. It really needs to have a setting to take advantage of tilt for brush size. That is one of my favorite things about the Apple Pencil and it is not taken advantage of in this app. Another thing I would like to have in this app is subfolders. I like order and I would like to be able to organize my notes in such a manner that I have large folders then more folders within my folders and so forth. Those are my two major complaints with this app. Overall though, I would recommend, I will definitely get my $10 out of this app.Dropped to one Star because the latest update has messed up the app. It is now glitching a lot and the notes won¡¯t quit ¡°syncing¡± with iCloud so I can¡¯t access them.

Update to a month and a half later.

Note sorting and text-friendly organization (ie, lists) have been thrown out the window for a shiny interface and lots of icons and flashy graphics I can't write with the confidence that EverNote will not crash, but HEY, I can take a picture of my pancakes and keep it for posterity Hey, EverFail, I quit I am canceling my membership today

,,,,,,"Update, EN performance has improved considerably (from 2 to 3 stars) since my last review, however the app remains pretty buggy It constantly reports failure to synch, it freezes momentarily between all actions, it crashes here and thee, and the search function sometimes fails to find key words I am borderline thinking of going premium, but also keeping an eye for alternatives Note, some of my problems may be related with some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7

Previous review,
After several months of daily use, and building about 1K pretty intensive notes, I was in the process to put a serious long-term commitment to EN- but I've had to seriously rethink this after the problems with the last upgrade The problems I've experienced are not as severe as what others are reporting Mine have been mostly with the iPad 2 version, while the desktop version w MacBook Air has continued to work OK 

On the iPad things have actually improved quite a bit over the past week, in terms of less freezes, when trying to do a search- so for me it is wait and see, to see if EN can get it together The searches have also become less efficient and clunky in all iPad &amp Mac desktop versions I am still working on EN, but will also be on stand-by, and looking for possible alternatives

I don't have many concerns w the new design, as others do-- but I do hope that EN programmers can stay focused on the real issues",,,,,,,positive,1

,,,,,,"This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.

There are a couple formatting issue suggestions:

1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.
2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?
3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.

Keep up the good work!",,,,,,,positive,1

HOWEVER, that is all cancelled out by trying to make you pay real money in order to keep playing. I believe it's 5 turns a day you get for free, so if you lose 5 times you have to either wait a specific amount of time or pay money to keep playing. 

This breaks up the gameplay because I refuse to make in-game payments of this sort. I HATE this type of payment system. I would much rather buy the game up-front for $1, $2, or even $3. If that option becomes available, I would definitely buy this game.",,,,,,,positive,1

The fact that it makes me do it with no way of turning it off other than hitting ""later"" every time it updates is a deal breaker.

,,,,,,"The only reason I moved to iOS7 was to get the newest version of Evernote Let me say, I have no idea what everyone is complaining about Super easy to add notes still No sync issues Handy announcements from Evernote The card view is still there, you just have to (gasp) look for a sec 

If you are having issues, contact support before blasting the app And take a deep breath folks Life isn't that bad",,,,,,,positive,1
,,,,,,"The only complaint I have about this app is that unless you live in one of the supported cities, it's pretty much useless. Even if you do live in a big city, the app won't help you at all if you're travelling somewhere smaller, which is why I recommend keeping a backup app like Urbanspoon on your iPhone as a backup.",,,,,,,negative,0
,,,,,,"The only app I couldn't live without! Practical, easy to use, beautiful  design  user experience, use it multiple times per day",,,,,,,positive,1
,,,,,,"The one good thing about the last update ws the ability to make folders. But, you are not able to make folders inside folders. I wish you could. The bad things about the last update? Now typing has lag which is very annoying. I don't see how that happened since there is no crazy graphical interface or anything animated. The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button. I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler. I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard. But now i wish it was back up top at least. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now since it is such a pain to tab unless you are using a bluetooth keyboard.",,,,,,,negative,0
,,,,,,"The new update loads slower, closes out on me when i press BACK from viewing photos, this update has glitches I don't like the search method and I wish you guys would make it easier to find RESORTS hotels similar to the ones you previously looked at like if I viewed a few months  ago a 5 star resort with a lazy river it show me similar resorts, I would like to stay at in another place (state,country)",,,,,,,negative,0
,,,,,,"The new release shows what a mature iOS app should look like. It performs incredibly well, while offering most features (if not all) that users could want. Not only is it now offered at a lower price, but there is an option to enhance the application with an upgrade. Since few users need the enhancements, it is a great way to offer them.",,,,,,,positive,1

,,,,,,"The inverted colors of the icon induce retinal after images, and in-app, the whiteout is hard on the eyes The experience on an iPad Air is one of huge expanses of white or badly contrasting off-whitelight blue and stencil-thin pale icons battling the brightness of it all The spartan look works fine on an iPhone, where there is proportionately less white assaulting the eye with the iPad, however, I keep trying to reduce the brightness of the display, but that only further impacts contrast and legibility 
Also why is it not possible to change names of files or folders??",,,,,,,negative,0

That way CCITT compression could be used and the space saving would be dramatic. 90 percent of my scans would be fine in high rez 1 bit.   I've yet to see another app that can save to 1 bit (though they can be read by most PDF viewers), but given storage size concerns, I don't see why scan apps don't include this as an option.   Great job on all the rest though.",,,,,,,positive,1

,,,,,,"The app is missing a few things compared to the computer based version, but overall functionality is pretty good The only reason I don't give the app 5 stars is because the new interface is absolutely ugly Although this is just a personal opinion, I feel that the layout is slightly inconvenient and confusing If this changes, I will give it 5 stars",,,,,,,negative,0

The developer has opted for the classic tap either side of the screen to move and drag the reticle to aim touch control system, it does not support controller or keyboard input. The result is a control system that is borderline unresponsive and makes fine movement or fast movement completely inefficient. This game is so tedious to play, it certainly isn't worth the hefty price tag associated with it. If you bought this during the sale; you got a great deal, but as someone who paid full price to support Team 17, I'm disappointed in this lackluster port. Overall the game is a great example of what can happen to a great idea when it's executed poorly.

I'm not sure what the indication is that it's reading your heart rate, as the ""dial"" moves around and then restarts constantly. Sometimes a blinking heart shows up. The instructions don't explain what the dial and heart icon are for. Keeping my finger in the same location would reveal a heart rate of 85... and then 31.

Watched the video on their website to look at the location of my finger in comparison to theirs--same spot. It's possible that the technique they use to measure the heart rate doesn't work on everyone--thus the vast disparity in ratings for the app. Seems to work for some people and not for others.

Automatic photovideo upload, iPhoto import, works with the Mailbox app, shared folders, photo aggregation on the website and mobile, the ability to store files only on the cloud (saves space on my Mac from old files)

and the obvious things like having everything backed up in real-time, and accessibility of my files from anywhere

I could do without it anymore! Remember when we just had computers and hoped they didn't break and lose all our files?

One suggestion if I have automatic photo upload on and download a photo to my phone's camera roll (say, for #TBT), don't automatically re-upload it to Camera Imports! It's already in Dropbox, silly And yes, obviously if I use Instagram or some other photo sharing software to doctor it, I know it's a different photo and will therefore upload",,,,,,,positive,1

Go horseback riding? Come to the historic Centro, where it is mapped but doesn't exist The most funny in accuracy is the pyramid supposedly a few blocks from my rental house

Next problem, related to this is the 'Near Me' function First, the app couldn't find me Instead, it thought I was in a town two hours away and showed me attractions for that town When I dragged the map to the town I am in there was more of the map craziness, but even worse The few locations that were accurately mapped now shifted to within a block or two from my house

Lastly, the new version is less functional than the previous version And it's a lot less functional than the website

Bottom line is that I am deleting until at least the map issues get fixed I am definitely unhappy with this version",,,,,,,negative,0

,,,,,,"I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the ""Scores"" page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.

However, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play-by-play. The ""team leaders"" appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--there's no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the ""Atlanta Falcons"" button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the ""Cincinnati"" button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product.

The new interface seems to have buried things I want most Such as Sync Now and Search Sync seems to be broken regardless

I am also unhappy with the iOS version of Evernote using my location as the default new note title instead of doing it like the desktop version does, using my first sentence 

Another new(?) annoyance is Search now ignores which folder you are in Always searching every note in your Evernote history is not efficient If I know a note I am searching for is in a certain folder I should not have to search through search hits from all my other folders Again, working like the desktop version would be better here

Finally, it would be nice if tag searching worked like it does on the web version of Evernote, evaluating the entire tag Not just the first word in the tag

Now all my notes are one dimensional and its impossible to organize my thoughts How could the Evernote team consider that this feature was unnecessary? Do you guys not use your own app?

2 Refresh Button
3 Button that Refreshes the Current Folder's contents
4 The air smells a bit Why don't we REFRESH it?
5 It is stupidly simple to add a refresh button
6 Mentos The Refresh Button Maker
7 There's space on the top left of the app header to add a refresh button  Nothing is there at the moment It's lonely
8 Give me an R, Give me an E, Give me an F, Give me an R, Give me an E, Give me an S, Give me an H! What does that spell? Easily implementable refresh button with high utility even to people who don't know they need it yet! Yaaay!",,,,,,,negative,0

There's not a lot of detail in the information, particularly in details for upcoming days. The forecast is no more specific than a high and low temp and a picture representation of the weather for the entire day. Nevertheless, this isn't meant to be too detailed, and it provides plenty of info for the current time. My biggest complaint is that the app crashes on startup often. Sometimes it will load the second time, sometimes it requires a restart of my iPad 3rd generation. It's a nice looking app, the kind that you would want to have on your iPad, it just has a stability problem.",,,,,,,negative,0

,,,,,,"Clear has one of the best-designed user interfaces I've ever encountered on the iPhone/iPad. It is the way apps should be. So simple and easy. I'm giving it 5 stars despite some shortcomings:

1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices.
2. It needs Reminders and Alerts (and Due Dates, etc.)
3. Some kind of support for longer notes. Right now, single-tapping an item lets you edit the item. Maybe double-tapping should let you open an item's ""detail page"" where you could enter the due date, add an alarm, or type a longer note. 
4. Also, sharing a list? It would be great if my wife and I could add to or just see each other's shopping lists. Though now, I admit this is ""feature creep"" that could detract from Clear's simplicity.",,,,,,,positive,1

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!

Ended up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.",,,,,,,negative,0

Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!

Ended up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.",,,,,,,negative,0
,,,,,,"///Update///

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.
