The only time I can use speaker is when the camera is on, meaning I have to have the camera flipping another way to have the person I¡¯m chatting with not see me. If there could be a speaker button for when you¡¯re calling someone without headphones, that¡¯ll be great. The only other thing I can think of, that I¡¯m really hoping gets fixed, is the emotes for group chat. My friends have no problem using it with their phones, but when it comes to iPhones, if I click emojis, they don¡¯t appear. The only way to make it appear is to type out the name. For example, we have an emote of a cat named henk, so when I would want to use it, I¡¯d have to type :henk:. Now we have a lot of emotes and it¡¯s difficult to remember the name of every single one. If there could be a way for iPhone users to use their emotes without having to type it out, it¡¯ll be nice. If there could also be a way for phone users to create emotes through their phones instead of uploading it to their computer that¡¯ll make things a bit more simple.

But the mobile version is missing quite a few important features. For example, Discord on mobile (possibly IOS only) doesn't have Audit Logs for server moderation. Audit Logs are very important for server moderation, so that is one flaw with the mobile app. Also, only a minor setback this is, is the fact that there is no emote button on the mobile app. Yes, you can easily tap the emoji button on your keyboard, but if you are in a server with global emotes, you have to type out the names of the emote. But, there is emote prediction, making this a minor set back. Finally, I want to mention this weird bug that happens sometimes; It is a bug when you can't join Voice Channels or Voice Calls; it just disconnects you automatically, and it does this for a loop. When you close the app and retry, the same results will happen. You usually have to wait hours before you can join a Voice Channel or Voice Call again. Thank you for making such a wonderful app!

Secondly, I use Notability in a setting where I¡¯m regularly working with several languages (including RTL - Right to Left languages like Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic). Notability does not have good support for combining multiple languages in one document at this time, especially not mixed English-Hebrew or English-Aramaic. Please give Notability the ability to recognize and format RTL languages. I can do that natively on most Apple apps, and many 3rd party apps, so the inability to do that on Notability really sticks out.

A found a workaround using semi-transparent boxes to overlay to the notes, but now this feature seemed gone with the latest updates, which is disappointing since updates shoul ¡°add¡± and not remove features. I hope someone from the developing team is reading these reviews .","However I found difficult importing external PDF in an open note as a page, and if this is the first page I cannot remove it anymore.",4,TRUE,efficiency,page,71,75,negative,0

This feature was just enough to annoy me to make the switch to another app. To clarify, you cannot name dividers, subjects under said dividers OR notes with the same name regardless of if they are in different subjects/dividers. - As an engineering student, shapes and diagrams are very important for my notes, being unable to snap draw shapes is more of an inconvenience than anything else. This could be clarified as a suggestion for those who think so.I have also voted on their website to change the one part of this app I extremely dislike. That being said, I¡¯m aware it takes a little while to update a feature like this, and if it is ever fixed I will use this app again. I am also aware that I paid money for this app and the company has the option to disregard any of my concerns given that they got what they wanted.

I¡¯m not joking.I first used gmail as an additional, non employer-based email for teaching, since I was also using google drive. Much more recently, I added two additional gmail accounts for volunteer duties. The problems? 1- The icons are not self-explanatory so I have no idea what touching X or Y will do. There¡¯s no way to ¡°hover¡± over an icon to figure out what it does before I click it. 2- I set up one gmail account on my computer and then added it on both my iPad and iPhone. It alone would not coordinate with the same exact email on my computer. The other two accounts showed up. NOT good when I am thinking ¡°no email¡± really means ¡°no email¡±. Nope - it only meant I didn¡¯t get the emails that I found (two weeks later!) In the gmail account on the computer.3- I sent out 6 mass mailings on that account today. I know they went out because one of the two included a BCC to me. But I cannot find ¡°trash¡± to find them. I cannot find them inv¡±send¡±- but I got the BCC on my AOL account.4- I regret using gmail but I am stuck with it as it us on the newsletters I produce.So if you have other choices, try them.

It seemed like every time I tried to sit down and start working, a new notification popped up on my screen- whether it was a text message, an email, or a game alert- and I couldn¡¯t stay focused.I love this app because it helps me stay on track and get work done. With the adorable game design aside, using this app is just super gratifying! Of course, the tiny trees are cute and it¡¯s fun to grow your own forest, but this app isn¡¯t just aesthetically pleasing: it¡¯s extremely functional. It allows me to focus, avoid distractions, and succeed in school. There¡¯s nothing you need to buy in order to use the app, so just download it and give it a try! If it doesn¡¯t work for you, then you can just delete it, but it might end up being super useful for you, just as it was for me!","With the adorable game design aside, using this app is just super gratifying!",5,TRUE,usability,design,24,30,positive,1

I¡¯m only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad. In conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating. Pretty much a scheme to get consumers to spend a lot of money.",There should be more levels that don¡¯t take multiple tries to get through.,2,TRUE,enjoyability,N/A,N/A,N/A,positive,1

With it being the imposter¡¯s job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win.

But I don¡¯t usually spend any money on apps unless I know I¡¯ll use it. Well, I played a few days straight while stuck at home for a bit at Christmas. The AI is ok but it was playing against other people I was looking forward to! I won the first two times and thought that I was gonna really love playing this. As I played more and more I noticed some frustrating things. I don¡¯t have to win all the time and make enough mistakes to know why I¡¯ve lost. But the inconsistency on the dice roll for all players is a predictable algorithm with no actual randomness. When I pay $4 I don¡¯t except the world but I would have liked the opportunity to earn thru winning, other boards and pieces. No leaderboard or way to keep stats in this digital world was a surprise.

The absolute fury that ensues within my body when I get a pair of Super (death) Sneakers and immediately slam into a bridge.. the feeling is truly something indescribable. Also, my cat has been missing for 3 days- this usually isn¡¯t relevant but I could find him, get him neutered, bring him home, AND feed him a succulent salmon dinner in the time that it takes to get my score to 100k in this game. A quick question as well, what am i to do when there isnt a single ad to watch, I have gone broke for hoverboards when they are being used to ease the painfully slow speed in the beginning, and everything is overpriced? just uhhhhhh lemme know. All that aside, I have played this game for many years and cant wait for the new update. Hopefully it brings things up to a 4 or 5.

But when i lost my iPod and got a new phone i didn¡¯t have it in my new phone and i just forgot to get up until recently when i decided to get it because my family was playing it. So i played it for the Miami world and the Peru world and i had most of the characters but when the Halloween update came out for this new season it wasn¡¯t updating my game. So i asked my cousin what to do and she said since you are logged on to Facebook and Game Center it will save your progress so i deleted the game so it would update and when i did i lost all my characters ( especially my favorite three Coco, Liu, and Aina). I was really sad about this but in the end i guess it¡¯s my fault for deleting the app, but i want to tell people that if this happens to you just wait it out especially if you¡¯re really far in the game sure you will miss out in a season but you won¡¯t loose your progress. Even though this happened i still have a lot of love for the game and anybody debating wether they should get the game or not definitely get this game it¡¯s really good!!!",Lily coco aina So i have loved this game for a long time i had it in my iPod and played it with my family.,5,TRUE,enjoyability,N/A,N/A,N/A,negative,0

First of all when the game updated it basically restarted the game and got rid of all my coins, keys, characters...everything. I am pretty mad about that because it took a long time to save up for all the characters I got. I¡¯m really lucky because I didn¡¯t use any money to buy anything. If I did and they deleted everything then that would mean I just spent and wasted a whole lot of money. And I¡¯m pretty sure that is what happened to other people who bought stuff using real money. Another thing is the design. It¡¯s not that great. The graphics and layout are really childish. And now for some reason the game takes FOREVER to load. And it also for some reason only works at a certain time of day. It didn¡¯t do that before this terrible update came out. And it¡¯s not my WiFi because every other game works expect this one ??. It¡¯s really annoying because I used to give this game 5 stars but now I¡¯m giving it 2 stars.....yeah that pretty bad.
