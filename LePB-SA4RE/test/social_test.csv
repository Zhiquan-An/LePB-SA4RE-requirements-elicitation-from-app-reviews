However, there are some things that I think could be tweaked. So I want to start off by addressing the calls. Everything is fine except the speaker. The only time I can use speaker is when the camera is on, meaning I have to have the camera flipping another way to have the person I¡¯m chatting with not see me. If there could be a speaker button for when you¡¯re calling someone without headphones, that¡¯ll be great. The only other thing I can think of, that I¡¯m really hoping gets fixed, is the emotes for group chat. My friends have no problem using it with their phones, but when it comes to iPhones, if I click emojis, they don¡¯t appear. The only way to make it appear is to type out the name. For example, we have an emote of a cat named henk, so when I would want to use it, I¡¯d have to type :henk:. Now we have a lot of emotes and it¡¯s difficult to remember the name of every single one. If there could be a way for iPhone users to use their emotes without having to type it out, it¡¯ll be nice. If there could also be a way for phone users to create emotes through their phones instead of uploading it to their computer that¡¯ll make things a bit more simple.

But the mobile version is missing quite a few important features. For example, Discord on mobile (possibly IOS only) doesn't have Audit Logs for server moderation. Audit Logs are very important for server moderation, so that is one flaw with the mobile app. Also, only a minor setback this is, is the fact that there is no emote button on the mobile app. Yes, you can easily tap the emoji button on your keyboard, but if you are in a server with global emotes, you have to type out the names of the emote. But, there is emote prediction, making this a minor set back. Finally, I want to mention this weird bug that happens sometimes; It is a bug when you can't join Voice Channels or Voice Calls; it just disconnects you automatically, and it does this for a loop. When you close the app and retry, the same results will happen. You usually have to wait hours before you can join a Voice Channel or Voice Call again. Thank you for making such a wonderful app!
