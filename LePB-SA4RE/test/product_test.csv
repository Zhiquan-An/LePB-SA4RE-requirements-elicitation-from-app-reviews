I decided to try using an iPad Pro instead, since they¡¯re lighter. Notability was the only app to offer most of the same functionality as OneNote on a Windows tablet. There are many things that I prefer about Notability, but there are a few issues that prevent me from giving it more stars: first, I would like the ability to create a group of commonly used highlighters/pens for marking up documents. I have a system of using certain colors to represent certain things, and I would like to be able to organize all those highlighters and pens into a group where I determine the order and placement. If that is possible in Notability, I haven¡¯t been able to figure it out. Secondly, I use Notability in a setting where I¡¯m regularly working with several languages (including RTL - Right to Left languages like Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic). Notability does not have good support for combining multiple languages in one document at this time, especially not mixed English-Hebrew or English-Aramaic. Please give Notability the ability to recognize and format RTL languages. I can do that natively on most Apple apps, and many 3rd party apps, so the inability to do that on Notability really sticks out. Please improve these issues, and I will gladly give it a 5 star rating.

Also, the app could be improved with a couple of very helpful additions: 1) to re-use the notes the following academic year, I would like to be able to ¡°hide¡± part of the notes, to ¡°unhide¡± one line at a time as I explain the notes; 2) an even better option would be to be able to create a greyed-out version of the notes in order to re-write on them during the class, i.e. as if I was writing for the first time.

This feature was just enough to annoy me to make the switch to another app. To clarify, you cannot name dividers, subjects under said dividers OR notes with the same name regardless of if they are in different subjects/dividers. - As an engineering student, shapes and diagrams are very important for my notes, being unable to snap draw shapes is more of an inconvenience than anything else. This could be clarified as a suggestion for those who think so.I have also voted on their website to change the one part of this app I extremely dislike. That being said, I¡¯m aware it takes a little while to update a feature like this, and if it is ever fixed I will use this app again.

There¡¯s no way to ¡°hover¡± over an icon to figure out what it does before I click it. 2- I set up one gmail account on my computer and then added it on both my iPad and iPhone. It alone would not coordinate with the same exact email on my computer. The other two accounts showed up. NOT good when I am thinking ¡°no email¡± really means ¡°no email¡±. Nope - it only meant I didn¡¯t get the emails that I found (two weeks later!) In the gmail account on the computer.3- I sent out 6 mass mailings on that account today. I know they went out because one of the two included a BCC to me. But I cannot find ¡°trash¡± to find them.
